# Fun-Language-5622
## User Stories:  
1. As a user, I wish to learn a new language and hence I would like to be able to select a language that I want to learn.  

2. As a learner, I would like to learn a new language of interest at a pace that I am comfortable in. I would hence prefer to choose a level of difficulty (basic, intermediate and advanced) for the language course that I am enrolled in, depending on my confidence level.  

3. As a learner, I wish to test my level of understanding for my enrolled language through proficiency assessments. I would also like to try out assessments for different levels to gauge my current competency for the enrolled language.

4. As a user, I would feel motivated to continue using the application if I can get incentives (achievements) during the course of my learning, such as completing courses and passing assessments.
