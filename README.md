# Fun-Language-5622
## User Stories:  
1. User selects which language they want to learn  

2. Enroll for courses on the language of choice varying in terms of difficulty (basic, intermediate, advanced)  

3. If the user opts for a higher difficulty course, he or she will be required to do the assessment for the preceding course if not done previously to determine whether they are able to enroll for the course of choice (otherwise enroll for preceding course)  

4. User can attempt the proficiency assessment found in each level once they feel confident (can do practice written test papers before attempting the test)  

5. Certificate of achievement sent to their email if they pass the assessment for the enrolled course  

6. Resources for reference
